# Retrom REST Service

The REST service provides certain backend functionalities that are
not well-suited for the gRPC service. This includes things such as
serving static assets and web pages, as well as handling downloads
of games and other large files from the browser.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [`retrom-service`](../service/README.md) package for details on setting
> up the development environment, running the service, and contributing.
