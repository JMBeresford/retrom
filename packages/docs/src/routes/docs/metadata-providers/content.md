# Metadata Providers

Retrom uses metadata providers to download metadata for your games. Currently, the only supported
provider is IGDB. Support for more providers is planned.

## IGDB

To use the IGDB metadata provider, you will need to create an account on the IGDB website and
create a new application to get your client ID and secret. You can do this by following the
instructions [here](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation).

Once you have credentials, add them to your configuration via the `File > Configuration` menu item:
