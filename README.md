# Retrom

A centralized game library/collection management service with a focus on emulation. Configure once, play anywhere.

> [!WARNING]  
> UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT: Expect breaking changes often, update your installation with care.

## Overview

Retrom is a centralized game library management service that allows you to host your games on a single device, and connect
clients on any amount of other devices to (un)install/download and subsequently launch said games locally.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> After installation, make sure to check out the [Quickstart guide](/docs/quick-start/README.md) to get
> up and running quickly.

> [!CAUTION]
> Retrom is designed **without** any specific security measures in mind. It is intended, and **highly recommended** that you run
> Retrom on a local network only. If you wish to expose Retrom to the internet, you should do so behind a reverse proxy
> with **proper security measures in place**. This is not a feature that is planned to be implemented in Retrom itself, as
> there are many variables to consider when hosting something and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

### Preparation

#### Library Structure

Retrom currently supports libraries with the following structures:

##### Multi-File Games (recommended)

Each game should be
represented by a directory containing the game files (even for single-file games/platforms).
Each game should similarly be contained within a directory representing the platform it is played
on, and the platform directories should live at the root of your `library` directory.

Example:

Assume you have the games:

- Plumber Dude
- Plumber Dude 2

For the Game Guy platform, and the games:

- Plumber Dude World
- Plumber Dude and Plumber Dude's Brother

For the Game Guy Advance platform. Your library should look like this:

```devicetree
library/
  game_guy/
    plumber_dude/
      plumber_dude.gg
    plumber_dude_2/
      plumber_dude_2_part_1.gg
      plumber_dude_2_part_2.gg
  game_guy_advance/
    plumber_dude_world/
      plumber_dude_world.gga
    plumber_dude_and_plumber_dudes_brother/
      plumber_dude_and_plumber_dudes_brother.gga
```

##### Single-File Games

Rather than each game being represented by a directory, you may have a library in which each game
is simple a single file in the respective platform directory.

Example:

Assume the same games and platforms as the example in [Multi-File Games](#multi-file-games-recommended).
Your library should look like this:

```devicetree
library/
  game_guy/
    plumber_dude.gg
    plumber_dude_2.gg
  game_guy_advance/
    plumber_dude_world.gga
    plumber_dude_and_plumber_dudes_brother.gga
```

#### Metadata Providers

Retrom uses metadata providers to download metadata for your games. Currently, the only supported
provider is IGDB. Support for more providers is planned.

##### IGDB

To use the IGDB metadata provider, you will need to create an account on the IGDB website and
create a new application to get your client ID and secret. You can do this by following the
instructions [here](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation).

### Server

> [!NOTE]
> Requirements
>
> - Docker
> - Docker Compose (optional, but recommended)
> - A PostgreSQL database (can optionally use the example provided below)
> - A game library that is organized in [a way that Retrom can understand](#library-structure)
> - API keys for [metadata providers](#metadata-providers)

The server is configured via a config file. Here is an example config file:

```json
{
  "connection": {
    "port": 5101,

    // for the example retrom-db container below
    "db_url": "postgres://minecraft_steve:super_secret_password@retrom-db/retrom"

    // or, bring your own database:
    // "db_url": "postgres://{db_user}:{db_password}@{db_host}/{db_name}"
  },
  "content_directories": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/my/library/",
      "storage_type": "MultiFileGame"
    },
    {
      "path": "path/to/my/library/with/single_file_games/",
      "storage_type": "SingleFileGame"
    }
  ],
  "igdb": {
    "client_secret": "super_secret_client_secret!!!1",
    "client_id": "my_IGDB_ID_1234"
  }
}
```

#### Docker (Recommended)

The currently recommended way to run the server is via Docker, ideally with `docker compose`.

> [!TIP]
> If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, you can read the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Let's adjust the above example `config.json` for our docker container, and save it somewhere safe. In this
example, we'll assume it is saved to `/home/minecraft_steve/config_dir/config.json`. Note that we need a
config _directory_ to mount into the container, not just the file itself.

Let's also assume we have libraries at `/home/minecraft_steve/library1/` and at `/home/minecraft_steve/library2/`.

Here is the example config file:

```json
{
  "connection": {
    "port": 5101,
    "db_url": "postgres://minecraft_steve:super_secret_password@retrom-db/retrom"
  },
  "content_directories": [
    {
      "path": "/library1", // this path is **inside the container**
      "storage_type": "MultiFileGame"
    },
    {
      "path": "/library2", // this path is **inside the container**
      "storage_type": "SingleFileGame"
    }
  ],
  "igdb": {
    "client_secret": "super_secret_client_secret!!!1",
    "client_id": "my_IGDB_ID_1234"
  }
}
```

Then, this example `docker-compose.yml` file will get you started:

```yaml
retrom:
  image: ghcr.io/jmberesford/retrom-service:latest
  ports:
    - 5101:5101
  volumes:
    - /home/minecraft_steve/config_dir:/config/ # directory containing your config file
    - /home/minecraft_steve/library1:/library1 # directory containing your first library
    - /home/minecraft_steve/library2:/library2 # directory containing your second library

# OPTIONAL: spin up a postgres container to use as the database, if you
# don't have one already.
#
# read the docs here: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
retrom-db:
  container_name: retrom-db
  hostname: retrom-db # this should match the db_url in your config file
  image: postgres:16
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    # to store the DB data on the host, change this path to any directory you like
    - /home/minecraft_steve/retrom_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: minecraft_steve # db user, used to connect to the db, should match the db_user in your config file
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: super_secret_password # db password for above user, should match the db_password in your config file
    POSTGRES_DB: retrom # db name, should match the db_name in your config file
```

You can then run `docker-compose up` in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file to start the service.

### Client

#### Desktop Client

Simply head to the [releases page](https://github.com/jmberesford/retrom/releases) and download the
latest version for your platform. The client is available for Windows, MacOS (both Intel and M series chips),
and Linux.

Occasionally, there may be debug builds present in a release. You should generally prefer
the non-debug builds, unless you were instructed to use a debug build by a developer for
debugging purposes. There will always be a non-debug version of any given release, just
look for an identically named file without the `-debug` suffix.

The following may help you differentiate between the different versions:

- `*-setup.exe` files are for Windows (prefer this over the .msi version, unless you have good reason not to)
- `*.msi` files are for Windows (prefer the .exe version over this)
- `*-x64.dmg` files are for MacOS on Intel chips
- `*-aarch64.dmg` files are for MacOS on M series chips
- `*-x64.AppImage` files are for Linux
- `*-x64.deb` files are for Linux (Debian-based distros)
- `*-x64.rpm` files are for Linux (Red Hat-based distros)

#### Web Client

> [!NOTE]
> There are plans to bundle the web client along with the service in a single container in the future,
> for ease of use.

The web client is currently only available as a Docker container. You can run it with the following
`docker-compose.yml` file, as an example:

```yaml
retrom-web:
  image: ghcr.io/jmberesford/retrom-web:latest
  container_name: retrom-web
  hostname: retrom-web
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
```

Then, you can run `docker-compose up` in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file to start the service.
You can then reach the web client at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, if running locally.
