## Overview

Retrom is a centralized game library management service that allows you to host your games on a single device, and connect
clients on any amount of other devices to (un)install/download and play them when and where you want to! Think of it as a
sort of _self-hosted Steam_ for your DRM-free game library.

## Core Features

- Host your own cloud game library service
- Scan your filesystem for games/platforms and automatically add them to your library
- Install/uninstall and play games from the service on any amount of desktop
  clients.
  - **Support for Windows, MacOS, and Linux!**
- Access your library from anywhere with the web client.
- Unify your emulation library with third party libraries
  - Steam
  - GoG (soonâ„¢)
  - Native PC / Linux / MacOS games (experimental)
- Manage emulator profiles on a per-client basis, stored on the server for easily
  sharing configurations between devices or restoring them after a reinstall.
- Launch all your games across any amount of emulators or platforms via your
  pre-configured profiles from a single library interface.
- Automatically download game metadata and artworks from supported providers
  to showcase your library with style!
