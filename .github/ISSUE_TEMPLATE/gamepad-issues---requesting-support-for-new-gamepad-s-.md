# Please explain the issue you are having w/ your gamepad

_example: my gamepad is recognized as  'generic' gamepad, can we add first-class support?_
_example: some buttons in my gamepad are not working while some are_
_example: the wrong button **labels** are being used for my controller, the `A` button is shown as `B` in Retrom's menus_
_example: my gamepad's default bindings are all screwed up, for example the `A` button of my controller is bound to `up`. Almost all buttons needed manual re-mapping._
_example: my gamepad is showing up as the wrong *non-generic* type, it's an xbox controller but shows playstation buttons_
